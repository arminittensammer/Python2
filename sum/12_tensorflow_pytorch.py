# General information on GPU programming
###############################################################################
# There are 2 major standards for communicating with GPUs:
# OpenGL: Supported by most GPUs (AMD and NVIDIA)
# CUDA: Optimized for scientific calculations and neural networks, restricted
# to NVIDIA GPUs.
# Both interfaces are relatively hardware dependent, especially newer NVIDIA
# GPUs benefit from the latest CUDA versions. However, not every NVIDIA GPU
# supports every CUDA version.
# There are 2 major factors that can slow down your GPU calculations:
# 1.: Bottleneck data-transfer: If your GPU has small memory or the transfer
# bandwidth is slow, loading your data from CPU RAM to GPU memory will become
# a major issue.
# 2.: Computation speed: The actual speed of your GPU computations might be
# not fast enough or the computations you issued might not be parallelized
# optimally.
# Rule of thumb: GPU utilization should be as high as possible,
# GPU memory and bandwidth utilization should be as low as possible. (You
# can check this in the NVIDIA server settings.)
# Important: Most GPUs only support float32 calculations!


###############################################################################
# Computational graphs
###############################################################################
# Using CUDA or OpenGL directly is possible but usually tedious. However, there
# are modules that allow for easier GPU utilization and optimization of your
# code. These modules typically require you to write abstract code that will
# get translated to a computational graph, which is optimized for one or
# multiple GPU(s) and/or CPU(s). Since we often need to calculate gradients in
# Machine Learning, some modules use the computational graph to automatically
# compute the gradients.
# Commonly used modules that also provide automatic gradient computation are:
# Theano (www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/):
#   Creates a static graph; Optimization for CPU(s) or a single GPU;
#   Predecessor of TensorFlow/PyTorch; Ceased development;
# TensorFlow1 (www.tensorflow.org):
#   Creates a rather static computational graph; Very popular in production
#   (pushed by Google/Deepmind); Optimization for CPU(s), GPU(s), TPU(s);
#   Very similar to Theano; Provides Tensorboard (visualization tools in
#   web-browser); Not very Python-like code;
# TensorFlow2 (www.tensorflow.org):
#   Creates a more dynamic computational graph; Very popular in production
#   (pushed by Google/Deepmind); Optimization for CPU(s), GPU(s), TPU(s);
#   More similar to PyTorch; Provides Tensorboard (visualization tools in
#   web-browser); More Python-like code; Partly uses Keras as interface;
# PyTorch (www.pytorch.org):
#   Creates a more dynamic computational graph; Very popular in research
#   (pushed by Facebook); Optimization for CPU(s), GPU(s)(, TPU(s));
#   Good for development and research; More Python-like code.
#
# All of these modules mainly deal with arrays and integrate nicely with
# numpy.
# There also exist modules that are wrappers for e.g. Neural Network design,
# such as Keras https://keras.io/ .

# NVIDIA drivers, CUDA, CUDNN
###############################################################################
# If you want to utilize your GPU for high-performance computation, you will
# have to install appropriate drivers. Having the latest driver versions can
# give you speed-ups. For NVIDIA GPUs there are 3 components that you have to
# consider in the setup: The GPU driver, CUDA, CuDNN (make sure that PyTorch
# or whatever module you want to use can use the CUDA version!)
# Current PyTorch: nvidia-driver-440, CUDA 10.2, CuDNN 7.6
#
# Instructions for NVIDIA GPU on Ubuntu 18.04:
# In terminal:
# 1.) Add repository for graphics drivers:
# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers
# sudo apt-get update
# 2.) Install the latest nvidia driver that supports the CUDA version you want.
# Check if version works with your GPU! E.g. here: https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/pytorch-release-notes/rel_19-11.html
# sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver-440
# Reboot machine.
# Activate the driver. (Go to Software -> Software&Updates -> additional drivers)
# Reboot machine.
# 3.) Install the latest CUDA supported by the module you want to use.
# Follow instructions on https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_distro=Ubuntu&target_version=1804&target_type=deblocal
# Reboot machine.
# 4.) Install the latest CuDNN supported by the module you want to use. You
# will need to create a NVIDIA dev account.
# follow instructions on https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn
# Reboot machine.
# 5.) Check your installation by typing
# nvidia-smi
# in the terminal.
# 6.) Install PyTorch
# pip3 install torch torchvision
# (See https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for other versions, e.g.
# CPU-only or conda.)
# 7.)
# Open Python interpreter and type "import torch" to test your installation.

# PyTorch
###############################################################################
# This section will give a very short introduction to PyTorch. For more
# detailed introductions please refer to the lecture in the next semester
# (Programming in Python II) or https://pytorch.org/tutorials/.

# We will start with a simple example for a computational graph. Let's assume
# we want to build a computational graph for the formula "c=a*b", where "a" and
# "b" are inputs and "c" should be our result.

# In Python we could write such a formula as:
a = 5.
b = 4.
c = a * b
print(f"Python c: {c}")
# ... which will give us 3 variables that point to float values. Variable "c"
# was created from variables "a" and "b". However, "c" only points to the
# result of the computation. If we had information about how "c" was computed
# (in our case that it is the result of a multiplication of "a" and "b"), we
# could apply optimization methods, automatic differentiation (=compute
# gradients automatically), and other magic. PyTorch (and others) store this
# information in a "computational graph". In case of PyTorch, this
# computational graph is built "on-the-fly" and quite pythonic, as we will
# see in a few lines. This is in contrast to Theano/Tensorflow 1, where one
# first creates the computational graph (symbolically without values) and then
# runs the graph while supplying input values.

# In PyTorch we could write our formula like this:
# Import numpy since we will be using arrays later
import numpy as np
# Import the PyTorch module, which is called "torch"
import torch
# Point "a" to PyTorch tensor (=node in graph) and keep track of gradients
a = torch.tensor([5.], requires_grad=True)
# Point "b" to PyTorch tensor (=node in graph) and keep track of gradients
b = torch.tensor([4.], requires_grad=True)
c = a * b  # Point "c" to multiplication of "a" and "b" (=node in graph)
# We now have defined 3 nodes in our graph (also called "tensors"). In PyTorch
# we can simply evaluate it by accessing the variable:
print(f"PyTorch c: {c}")  # Prints the tensor

# Since "c" is pointing to a PyTorch tensor, we have access to the benefits
# of the computational graph. Furthermore, the computation of "c" is optimized
# (by default for CPU). Some examples on what we can do with the tensor:

# Access the value as Python object:
print(f"c.item(): {c.item()}")

# Get computational graph for gradient computation
print(f"c.grad_fn: {c.grad_fn}")

# Compute gradients of "c" w.r.t. its input nodes...
c.backward()
# ... the gradients that were computed are now accumulated in the nodes:
print(f"a.grad: {a.grad}")  # this is the derivative of "c" w.r.t. "a"
# ("c=a*b" ... derivative of this "c" w.r.t. "a" is "1*b", which has value 4.)
print(f"b.grad: {b.grad}")  # this is the derivative of "c" w.r.t. "b"
# Important: The gradients are accumulated in the nodes. If you want to reset
# them you have to call
a.grad.data.zero_()
# to reset it. This comes in handy in ML applications (resetting is easier too,
# as we will see later).


#
# Let's take this a step further and make our graph more complex
#
a = torch.tensor([5.], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor([4.], requires_grad=True)
c = a * b
c.retain_grad()  # this will keep the computed gradient for "c"
d = a * c
# ... now our graph is a little longer. We can still use
print(f"d.grad_fn: {d.grad_fn}")
d.backward()  # computes derivative of c*a = a*b*a
print(f"a.grad: {a.grad}")
print(f"b.grad: {b.grad}")
print(f"c.grad: {c.grad}")


#
# We can remove/detach a node from the graph using .detach()
#
a = torch.tensor([5.], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor([4.], requires_grad=True)
c = a * b
c.retain_grad()  # this will keep the computed gradient for "c"
c = c.detach()  # this will detach "c" from the graph (=its "history")
d = a * c
print(f"d.grad_fn: {d.grad_fn}")
d.backward()  # computes derivative of c*a = 20*a
print(f"a.grad: {a.grad}")
print(f"b.grad: {b.grad}")
print(f"c.grad: {c.grad}")

# We can convert tensors that have no gradient information to numpy arrays:
print(f"c.detach().numpy(): {c.detach().numpy()}")

# If you want a code block were gradients are in general not stored, you can
# use
with torch.no_grad():
    # There are no gradients computed/stored in this code block
    e = a * b
    print(e)


#
# Optimizing parameters
#
# We can easily create parameters that we want to optimize/train in PyTorch.
a = torch.tensor([5.], requires_grad=True)
b = torch.tensor([4.], requires_grad=True)
# But now we create a trainable parameter "w" from tensor "a"
w = torch.nn.Parameter(a, requires_grad=True)
# We compute some output tensor "output" given "w" and "b":
output = w * b

# ... but we would like "output" to be close to the value "target":
target = torch.tensor(10.)

# We can use gradient descent to change "w" such that "output" is closer
# to "prediction":
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([w], lr=0.01)  # use SGD optimizer
for update in range(25):  # for 25 updates
    output = w * b
    loss = (output - target) ** 2  # MSE loss
    loss.backward()  # Calculate gradients
    optimizer.step()  # Do 1 SGD step (changes the value of "w")
    optimizer.zero_grad()  # Reset gradients (or they would be accumulated)
    print(f"update:{update}; loss={loss.item()}; w={w.item()}")


#
# PyTorch and arrays
#
# PyTorch and numpy work together nicely. PyTorch tensors can be arrays and,
# for a large part, used the same way as numpy arrays (indexing, computations,
# arithmetic functions, etc.).
a = torch.arange(5*4).reshape(5, 4)
print(f"a.shape: {a.shape}")
print(f"a.sum(): {a.sum()}")

# We can also create tensors from numpy arrays:
a = torch.tensor(np.arange(5*4).reshape(5, 4))
print(f"a.shape: {a.shape}")
print(f"a.sum(): {a.sum()}")


#
# Utilizing GPU or CPU
#
# This section only works if you have a GPU and installed Pytorch with CUDA.
# PyTorch uses the CPUs as default device. To perform computations on a
# different device, you can either create tensors on this device or "send"
# tensors from one device to another device.
# Syntax for devices: "cpu" for CPU and "cuda:x" for GPU with ID x.
a = torch.tensor([5.], requires_grad=True, device='cpu')  # create on CPU...
a = a.to(device='cuda:0')  # ... and send to GPU0
b = torch.tensor([4.], requires_grad=True, device='cuda:0')  # create on GPU0
c = a * b  # this is computed on GPU0 since the nodes are on GPU0!
print(f"GPU c: {c}")  # Prints the tensor, which is on GPU0

# Since "c" is on the GPU, CPU operations will not work (e.g. numpy):
# print(c.detach().numpy())  # not possible for GPU tensors

# However, we can copy "c" to the CPU easily using .cpu():
print(f"Numpy c: {c.detach().cpu().numpy()}")

# We can compare the speed of matrix computations on CPU vs. GPU:
import time

a = torch.arange(1000*1000, dtype=torch.float32,
                 device='cpu').reshape((1000, 1000))
b = torch.arange(1000*1000, dtype=torch.float32,
                 device='cpu').reshape((1000, 1000))
c = torch.ones_like(a)
with torch.no_grad():
    start_time = time.time()
    for _ in range(1000):
        c = a * b / c.mean()
    c = c.mean()
    end_time = time.time()
print(f"CPU result: {c} ({end_time-start_time} sec)")

a = torch.arange(1000*1000, dtype=torch.float32,
                 device='cuda:0').reshape((1000, 1000))
b = torch.arange(1000*1000, dtype=torch.float32,
                 device='cuda:0').reshape((1000, 1000))
c = torch.ones_like(a)
with torch.no_grad():
    start_time = time.time()
    for _ in range(1000):
        c = a * b / c.mean()
    c = c.mean()
    end_time = time.time()
print(f"GPU result: {c} ({end_time-start_time} sec)")

# PyTorch for ML/NN

# PyTorch offers many functions for ML and especially NNs. This includes
# tools for creating networks (torch.nn),
# reading data (torch.utils.data.Dataset),
# optimizing parameters (torch.optim), etc..

# This is a short introduction to Tensorflow 1 from a past semester.
# Tutorials: https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/
# Main source for this code:
# https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners

# The common abbreviation for tensorflow is tf:
import tensorflow as tf

#
# General usage schema
#

# Create a tf session (here we will define our graph in).
sess = tf.Session()

# Create tf variables
a = tf.constant(5, dtype=tf.float32)
b = tf.constant(3, dtype=tf.float32)
print("a: {}\nb: {}".format(a, b))

# Define your computations (these return symbolic tensors which will be
# added to our graph and computed only when we execute the graph)
c = a + b
print("c: {}".format(c))

# Evaulate (=run) the parts of the graph you want to evaluate:
c_eval = sess.run(c)  # specify tensors to compute as list
print("evaluated c: {}".format(c_eval))
# Session.run() will evaluate the tensors you provide as arguments to it;
# Tensors not used for the evaluations (=not connected to the evaluated nodes)
# will be ignored;

# By default, tf allocates all GPU memory on all GPUs available. We will
# see how to change this later. On some machines this will free the memory:
sess.close()  # if this doesn't work, close your python interpreter


#
# Dynamic memory allocation and device selection
#

# You can restrict the GPUs tf sees by setting this environment variable:
import os
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0"  # this will only make GPU 0 visible

import numpy as np  # we will use numpy for its datatypes
import tensorflow as tf

# You can set flags at python start or via the tf config objects passed to the
# session:
config = tf.ConfigProto()  # Create a config object
config.inter_op_parallelism_threads = 2  # max processes for parallel tasks
config.intra_op_parallelism_threads = 2  # max processes for task
config.gpu_options.allow_growth = True  # allocate memory dynamically when needed

# Start tf session
sess = tf.Session(config=config)


#
# Passing values to the tf graph
#

# You can use placeholders to pass values to CPU; you have to specify the shape
# your values will have (empty tuples for scalars); 1 dimension may be set
# variable via None;
a = tf.placeholder(shape=tuple(), dtype=tf.float32)
print("a: {}".format(a))
# Note: This is considered slow in some cases; for best performance use
# background tensorflow queues.

# Create other tf variables
b = tf.constant(3, dtype=tf.float32)
print("b: {}".format(b))

# Define your computations (you can use placeholders like other tensors)
c = a + b
print("c: {}".format(c))

# Execute (=run) the parts of the graph you want to evaluate but you need to
# specify the values of your placeholders via a feed-dictionary:
python_variable = np.float32(5)
c_eval = sess.run(c, feed_dict={a: python_variable})
print("evaluated c: {}".format(c_eval))


#
# Building a 1-layer neural network
#

# Tensorflow already provides some example datasets, in this case we will use
# the MNIST digits dataset (handwritten digits that need to be classified by
# our neural network):
from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data

# Load the MNIST data; images will be 1D 784 element-vectors; targets digits
# between 0-9 will be one-hot encoded:
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets(train_dir='MNIST_data', one_hot=True)

# Create the placeholder variables
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 784])  # our placeholder for input data
y_ = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 10])  # our placeholder for our targets

# Create trainable network variables
w = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([784, 10]))  # our network weights
b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([10]))  # our biases

# Calculate the network output (with identity activation function)
y = tf.matmul(x, w) + b

# Calculate the loss per sample
cross_entropy_loss = tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y_,
                                                             logits=y)

# Take mean over losses in minibatch
cross_entropy_loss = tf.reduce_mean(cross_entropy_loss)

# Define our optimizer for the weights
optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5)

# Apply our optimizer on our loss - this would be 1 weight update
update_step = optimizer.minimize(cross_entropy_loss)

# Initialize our trainable variables
initializers = tf.global_variables_initializer()
sess.run(initializers)

# Create our update loop:
for episode in range(10000):
    # Get samples for next minibatch
    batch_x, batch_y_ = mnist.train.next_batch(100)
    
    # Feed minibatch to graph, perform/calculate weight update and loss; we
    # can specify multiple tensors to evaluate by putting them in a list:
    interesting_tensors = [update_step, cross_entropy_loss]
    feed_dictionary = {x: batch_x, y_: batch_y_}
    
    _, train_loss = sess.run(interesting_tensors, feed_dict=feed_dictionary)
